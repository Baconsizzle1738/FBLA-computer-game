FBLA game

This Game was created by Hao Zheng and Clayton Xu.


#Basic concepts and components:

The basic concept of this game is that it is like a sort of escape room that the player must navigate through until the end. Each room is distinct and has a puzzle that references different games, and the player (blue box) must solve the puzzles whilst avoiding the enemies, which are always red. The game has different components to it, like obstacles(which can be any color except red), "interactables"(an instruction to press E to interact will appear when the player is over it), and drops, which the player automatically collects(like the arrows in Room one). The clues to solving the puzzle can be found in various ways, including but not limited to the room title, the dialogue lines, etc. The score of the player is calculated based on the time that they complete the level, with a bonus for any remaining health points and lives.

#Documentation:

Documentation is within the source code and done in the Javadoc format. Any method that has a Javadoc in its parent method will not have a Javadoc as it is already documented.

#Running:

To run the game, download the folder named "Get Gamed" and run  the .jar file inside. This was coded in Java 14 and tested on Windows 10 & Windows 8. Make sure that your PC can run java 14.
If you cannot download the  directly from the repository, you can make a folder named "Get Gamed" on your local machine and place the runnable jar in it(the individual .jar file from the repo), and then make a folder named "data" in your "Get Gamed" folder.
