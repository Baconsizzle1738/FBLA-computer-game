This Game was created by Hao Zheng and Clayton Xu.


#Basic concepts and components:

The basic concept of this game is that it is like a sort of escape room that the player must navigate through until the end. Each room is distinct and has a puzzle that references different games, and the player (blue box) must solve the puzzles whilst avoiding the enemies, which are always red. The game has different components to it, like obstacles(which can be any color except red), "interactables"(an instruction to press E to interact will appear when the player is over it), and drops, which the player automatically collects(like the arrows in Room one). The clues to solving the puzzle can be found in various ways, including but not limited to the room title, the dialogue lines, etc. The score of the player is calculated based on the time that they complete the level, with a bonus for any remaining health points and lives.
